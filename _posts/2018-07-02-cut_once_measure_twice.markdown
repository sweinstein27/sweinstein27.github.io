The difficulty of building something new is that you can't be sure how it's going to go. My progress looked very much like an Olympic hurdle event, with short sprints followed by hurdles that slowed me down. My first obstacle was the largest and turned out to be the trickiest. I planned to scrape stock data from CNBC.com. After installing nokogiri and openURI and trying to query the data, I found that no CSS selector returned any data. I was puzzled. I was sure my code was correct and should have returned the corresponding data. I met with a technical coach and found out the site was built to prevent scraping. 

I decided to pivot, scraping CNBC.com wouldn't work, so I decided to use CNN Money. The change made much of my code worthless. My failure taught me a valuable lesson to check the viability of a plan before starting.

As my old shop teacher used to say, "cut once, measure twice!"
