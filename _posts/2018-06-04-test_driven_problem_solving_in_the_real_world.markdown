Over the past few weeks working through the online web developer program I have noticed a change in my mindset. I approach problems in life differently. I break problems down into sizeable chunks and start with the assumptions.

Last Saturday my new grill was not working properly, the temperature would not go past 300 degrees. The temperature would rise rapidly to 300 degrees then stop. It made no sense! It was time to troubleshoot. Thankfully, I leanred TDD and IF statements. If the grill will not get hot it must not be getting enough gas or something is stopping the burner from getting to maximum heat. After checking the gas line for leaks and checking the regulators, I realized the burner in the "off" position was not actually off. Upon further review, the knobs for the grill were installed improperly and restricted the burner from going beyond 50%. Several months ago I am not sure I would have been able to handle this problem so methodically.
