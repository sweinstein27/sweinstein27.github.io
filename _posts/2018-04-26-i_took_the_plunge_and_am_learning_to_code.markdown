Throughout my life, I have loved technology. My first computer was a grey Hewlett Packard Windows 95 pc that was so big we need a thing called a “computer room.” The first interaction I had with a computer was installing 250 games from a floppy disk. Through the years, I became the go-to resource for computer questions for my entire family. I successfully taught my grandmother and grandfather how to use the internet. 

I never thought technology would be a career for me. I had a vision of development as boring and anti-social. As an outgoing person, I did not know if not talking to someone all day would go well. I could not have been more wrong! My senior year of college I took an intro to programming course and the professor required pair programming and teams for every portfolio project. I loved working with others and building of the enthusiasm that brought. I continued with my finance degree and accepted a sales job at AWS.

At AWS a colleague of mine showed me a script he wrote to tell him if an Apple store had any AirPods while he was driving. I thought it was the coolest thing, so I vowed to learn to code. Over the next year, I took courses off and on with Coursera and Codeacademy. The lack of structure made it difficult to progress; I needed a plan.
Frustrated and unsatisfied with my current job, I decided to give coding another try. I knew I could not learn on my own, so I joined a free prep course on Learn. I was amazed how much I learned and decided to join their Web Developer Course. It is only two weeks in, but I am amazed at the growth and improvement I have made.

HAPPY CODING!
